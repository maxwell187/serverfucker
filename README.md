# serverfucker

The Serverfucker project was made by me back in 2015, when I started with java. 
I decided to recode it and it was actually pretty fun, so I decided to release it on github.

How to use?

Pretty easy: just open this project in your IDE and build it. Done.

Any APIs?

Its enough if you use the standart SpigotAPI for version 1.8.x.

Thats it!
